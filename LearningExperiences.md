Learning Experiences

1. the importance of using variables instead of hardcoding numbers (for the bounds of the buttons and the x-y coordinates)
This was a huge mistake I made earlier and had to spend a long time to correct it and wasted a lot of time in the process. After I assigned the height, width, x, y coordinates some variables everything became so much simpler and cleaner.

2. It is some times better to write longer code as a tradeoff for better readability.

3. Google and YouTube are lifesavers. At first I could not make heads or tails of what the error codes meant and what I was supposed to do but when I started to google the documentation and watch Youtube videos to look up how to implement certain methods correctly, it made life so much easier.

4. Semantic errors are so incredibly difficult to find. Therefore, it is important to check code quality and if the code works correctly or not very often.
