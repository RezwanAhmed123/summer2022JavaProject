# summer2022JavaProject
I have been learning Java for about 2 weeks now and I wanted to do a long project to put my coding skills to the test. I came up with the idea of a simplistic calculator in a GUI window. It is very rudimentary in nature and I have not added any exception catching functionality. I need to work on that in the future. I will be adding a readme file later to pen down my learning experiences here too
